# Supplemental CODE for CSFpulse calculation from EPI fMRI data
This code is used to process CSFpulse technique proposed to calculate the CSF pulsation using an EPI-based fMRI dataset.
Please cite the following reference if you use these codes:
Kim, J. H., Im, J. G., & Park, S. H. (2022). Measurement of CSF pulsation from EPI-based human fMRI. Neuroimage, 257, 119293.

- The data type can be either nii or Nifti.
- These codes are running based on Matlab 2020a.
- Manual processes are needed to specify 4th ventricle pair slices and set the CSF ROIs on those slices.
